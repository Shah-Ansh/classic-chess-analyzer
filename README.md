# **Lichess Class Chess Game Analyzer**

## **Explore Your Lichess.org Class Games Visually**

This project delves into the world of data visualization, empowering you to analyze your Lichess.org classic chess games through insightful visual representations. Provide the URL to your game, and witness the game summary come alive!

## **Key Features**

- **Interactive Insights:** Gain a deeper understanding of your game through the innovative visualization, allowing you to see the game from new angle.
- **Enhanced Learning:** Visualizations can provide a more intuitive way to analyze game patterns and identify areas for improvement.

## **Technology Stack**

This project might leverage various web technologies depending on your specific implementation, potentially including:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the web page.
- **JavaScript:** Enables interactive visualizations and user interaction.
- **CSS:** Styles the page for a visually appealing presentation.
- **Lichess.org API:** Retrieve game data, from the url provided by the user.

## **Running the Project**

1. **Obtain the Files:** Download or clone the project repository to acquire the necessary files.

```
    git clone https://github.com/Shah-Ansh/classic-chess-analyzer.git
```

2. **Set Up Game Data:** cd into the directory containing `csv-generator.py`.

   - Copy the link of your class chess games from lichess.org in the format "https://lichess.org/gameId/*" without quotes.
   - Run `python csv_generator.py` in your terminal to generate an example CSV file with chess games played on lichess.org.
   - We currently support _Classic_ mode of the game. If the game format doesn't match, the game cannot be visualised.

3. **Open the Interface:** Run the `index.html` on local server. You can use any browser to do this; I recommend Google Chrome due to its robust support of HTML.
